This is a fork of [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) which includes the following additional features:

# Connection load balancing

Users can use this feature in two configurations.

### Cluster-aware / Uniform connection load balancing

In the cluster-aware connection load balancing, connections are distributed across all the tservers in the cluster, irrespective of their placements.

To enable the cluster-aware connection load balancing, provide the parameter `loadBalance` set to true as `loadBalance=true` in the connection url or the connection string (DSN style).

```
"postgresql://username:password@localhost:5433/database_name?loadBalance=true"
```

With this parameter specified in the url, the driver will fetch and maintain the list of tservers from the given endpoint (`localhost` in above example) available in the YugabyteDB cluster and distribute the connections equally across them.

This list is refreshed every 5 minutes, when a new connection request is received.

Application needs to use the same connection url to create every connection it needs, so that the distribution happens equally.

### Topology-aware connection load balancing

With topology-aware connnection load balancing, users can target tservers in specific zones by specifying these zones as `topologyKeys` with values in the format `cloudname.regionname.zonename`. Multiple zones can be specified as comma separated values.

The connections will be distributed equally with the tservers in these zones.

Note that, you would still need to specify `loadBalance=true` to enable the topology-aware connection load balancing.

```
"postgresql://username:password@localhost:5433/database_name?loadBalance=true&topologyKeys=cloud1.region1.zone1,cloud1.region1.zone2"
```
### Specifying fallback zones

For topology-aware load balancing, you can now specify fallback placements too. This is not applicable for cluster-aware load balancing.
Each placement value can be suffixed with a colon (`:`) followed by a preference value between 1 and 10.
A preference value of `:1` means it is a primary placement. A preference value of `:2` means it is the first fallback placement and so on.If no preference value is provided, it is considered to be a primary placement (equivalent to one with preference value `:1`). Example given below.

```
"postgres://username:password@localhost:5433/database_name?loadBalance=true&topologyKeys=cloud1.region1.zone1:1,cloud1.region1.zone2:2";
```

You can also use `*` for specifying all the zones in a given region as shown below. This is not allowed for cloud or region values.

```
"postgres://username:password@localhost:5433/database_name?loadBalance=true&topologyKeys=cloud1.region1.*:1,cloud1.region2.*:2";
```

The driver attempts to connect to a node in following order: the least loaded node in the 1) primary placement(s), else in the 2) first fallback if specified, else in the 3) second fallback if specified and so on.
If no nodes are available either in primary placement(s) or in any of the fallback placements, then nodes in the rest of the cluster are attempted.
And this repeats for each connection request.

## Specifying Refresh Interval

Users can specify Refresh Time Interval, in seconds. It is the time interval between two attempts to refresh the information about cluster nodes. Default is 300. Valid values are integers between 0 and 600. Value 0 means refresh for each connection request. Any value outside this range is ignored and the default is used.

To specify Refresh Interval, use the parameter `ybServersRefreshInterval` in the connection url or the connection string.

```
"postgres://username:password@localhost:5433/database_name?ybServersRefreshInterval=X&loadBalance=true&topologyKeys=cloud1.region1.*:1,cloud1.region2.*:2";
```
Here, X is the value of the refresh interval (seconds) in integer.

For a working example which demonstrates the configurations of connection load balancing see the [driver-examples](https://github.com/yugabyte/driver-examples/tree/main/nodejs) repository.

Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js. Pure JavaScript and optional native libpq bindings.

## Monorepo

This repo is a monorepo which contains the core [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg) module as well as a handful of related modules.

## Documentation

Each package in this repo should have its own readme more focused on how to develop/contribute. For overall documentation on the project and the related modules managed by this repo please see:

### :star: [Documentation](https://node-postgres.com) :star:

The source repo for the documentation is https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres-docs.

### Features

### Extras

node-postgres is by design pretty light on abstractions. These are some handy modules we've been using over the years to complete the picture.
The entire list can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Extras).

## Support

node-postgres is free software. If you encounter a bug with the library please open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres). If you have questions unanswered by the documentation please open an issue pointing out how the documentation was unclear & I will do my best to make it better!

When you open an issue please provide:

- version of Node
- version of Postgres
- smallest possible snippet of code to reproduce the problem

You can also follow me [@briancarlson](https://twitter.com/briancarlson) if that's your thing. I try to always announce noteworthy changes & developments with node-postgres on Twitter.

## Sponsorship :two_hearts:

## Contributing

**:heart: contributions!**

I will **happily** accept your pull request if it:

- **has tests**
- looks reasonable
- does not break backwards compatibility

If your change involves breaking backwards compatibility please please point that out in the pull request & we can discuss & plan when and how to release it and what type of documentation or communication it will require.

### Setting up for local development

1. Clone the repo
2. From your workspace root run `yarn` and then `yarn lerna bootstrap`
3. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL instance running with SSL enabled and an empty database for tests
4. Ensure you have the proper environment variables configured for connecting to the instance
5. Run `yarn test` to run all the tests
